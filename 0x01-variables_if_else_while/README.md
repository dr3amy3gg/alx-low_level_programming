0 this program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed, write source code to print whether the number stored in variable n is positive or negative; n will store a different value every time program is run; output should be number followed by whether or not its greater than zero, is it is zero, if its less than zero; followed by new line  
1 this program assigns a random number to the variable n, complete source code to print last digit of of number stored in n; out put should be 'Last digit of' followed by n, followed by 'is' followed by if last digit is greater than 5 'and is greater than 5'; if last digit is zero; if last digit is less than 6 and not zero; with newline  
2 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line; only use putchar function; all code in main; only use putchar twice in code  
3 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line; only use putchar; in main; use putchar three times  
4 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line; print all characters except q and e; in main; putchar twice  
5 write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from zero followed by a new line; all in main  
6 write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 from zero, followed by new line; no variables of type char; only use putchar, twice; in main  
7 writ a program that prints lowercase alphabet in reverse, newline; only putchar, twice; in main   
8 write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, newline; only putchar, three times; in main
