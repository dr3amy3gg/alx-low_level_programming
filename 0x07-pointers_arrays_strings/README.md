0 write a function that fills memory with a constant byte; fills n bytes of memory pointed to by s with the constant b; returns pointer to memory area  
1 write a function that copies memory area; copies n bytes from src to memory area dest; return a pointer to dest  
2 write a function that locates a character in a string; returns pointer to first occurrence of character c in string s, or NULL if character is not found  
3 write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring; return number of bytes in initial segment of s which consists of only bytes from accept  
4 write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes; locates the first occurrence in string s of any of the bytes in string accept; returns pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if nonexistent  
5 write a function that locates a substring; the function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack; null bytes not compared; returns a pointer to the beginning of located substring or NULL
