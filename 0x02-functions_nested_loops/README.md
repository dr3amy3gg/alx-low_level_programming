0 write a program that prints _putchar followed by new line; return 0  
1 write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line; prototype: void print_alphabet(void);; only use putchar twice  
2 write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by new line; only use _putchar twice; prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void)  
3 write a function that checks for lowercase character; prototype int _islower(int c); return 1 if lowercase; else return 0  
4 write a function that checks for alphabetic characters; prototype: int _isalpha(int c); return 1 if it is a letter lower or uppercase; return 0 otherwise  
5 write a function that prints the sign of a number; prototype: int print_sign(int n); return 1 and print + if positive, return 0 and print 0 if zero, return -1 and print - if negative  
6 write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer; prototype: int _abs(int)  
7 write a fucntion that prints the last digit of a number; prototype: int print_last_digit(int); return value of last digit  
8 write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59; prototype: void jack_bauer(void)  
9 write a function that prints the 9 times tables, starting with 0; prototype: void times_table(void)  
10 write function that adds two integers and returns the result  
11 write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line; prototype: void print_to_98(int n); numbers must be separated by comma and space; printed in order; the first printed number should be number passed to function; last number should be 98; can use standard library  
12 write a timetable that prints the n timetable, starting with 0; void print_times_table(int n); if n < 0 or > 15 don't print anything  
13 if we list natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 and 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1024(excluded), followed by a new line; can use stdio
