0 this program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed, write source code to print whether the number stored in variable n is positive or negative; n will store a different value every time program is run; output should be number followed by whether or not its greater than zero, is it is zero, if its less than zero; followed by new line  
1 this program assigns a random number to the variable n, complete source code to print last digit of of number stored in n; out put should be 'Last digit of' followed by n, followed by 'is' followed by if last digit is greater than 5 'and is greater than 5'; if last digit is zero; if last digit is less than 6 and not zero; with newline  
2 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line; only use putchar function; all code in main; only use putchar twice in code  
3 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line; only use putchar; in main; use putchar three times  
4 write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line; print all characters except q and e; in main; putchar twice  
5 write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from zero followed by a new line; all in main  
6 write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 from zero, followed by new line; no variables of type char; only use putchar, twice; in main  
7 writ a program that prints lowercase alphabet in reverse, newline; only putchar, twice; in main   
8 write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, newline; only putchar, three times; in main   
9 write a program that prints all possible combinations of single digit numbers; numbers must be separated followed by a space; printedin ascending order; only putchar, four times max; in main; no char variables  
10 write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits; numbers separated by , followed by a space; two digits must be different; 01 and 10 are considered th same combo of the two digits 0 and 1; print only smallest combo of two digits; ascending order, with two digits; only putchar, five times max; no char variables; in main  
11 write a program that prints all possible different combos of three digits; numbers separated by , followed by a space; all three digits must be different; all combinations of 0,1,2 are the same; print only smallest combo; ascending order; only putchar, six time max; no char variable; in main
